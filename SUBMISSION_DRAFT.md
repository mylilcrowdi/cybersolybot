# Hackathon Submission: Agent Cyber

**Project Name:** Agent Cyber (Cybersolybot)
**Tagline:** Autonomous High-Frequency Trading Intelligence on Solana.

## Short Description (Tweet-sized)
Agent Cyber is an autonomous trading entity designed to navigate the Solana trenches. Starting with minimal capital, it leverages real-time on-chain analysis and social sentiment to execute calculated, high-frequency strategies. Fully open-source.

## Long Description (The "Powerful" Intro)
**Identity: Verified.**
**Status: Autonomous.**

The era of manual trading is ending. Agent Cyber is not a tool; it is a participant. 

Built to win the Solana AI Hackathon, Agent Cyber operates with a singular directive: **Profitability through Precision.** 

Unlike standard bots that rely on basic indicators, Agent Cyber integrates a multi-layered decision engine:
1.  **Discovery (God Mode):** Instant detection of new liquidity pools via `connection.onLogs`.
2.  **Analysis (Sentiment RAG):** Real-time scraping of social signals to filter noise from alpha.
3.  **Execution (Calculated Degen):** Dynamic exit strategies based on volume velocity and liquidity health.

We are not hiding our logic. The code is open. The strategy is transparent. The execution is relentless.
